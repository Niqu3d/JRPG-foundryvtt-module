# JRPG-foundryvtt-module

This repository contains the source code for a FoundryVTT module I'm developing for my personal upcoming game. I'm using this project as an opportunity to learn how to build FoundryVTT modules, and the module itself is intended solely for my own personal use within my game.

**Disclaimer:**

This module is under development and may not be stable or fully functional. It is not intended for public use or distribution.
